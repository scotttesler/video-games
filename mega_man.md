  > For the NES, I recommend Mega Man 3 Revamped to everyone I can, as it feels like the “definitive” edition of the game that could have been. Redone Doc Robot stages, longer and more challenging Wily levels, and fixes to the lackluster weapons. https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4773/ is the link to the hack page.

  > Also on the NES, try Rockman 4 Minus Infinity. This is one of the best and most professional hacks I’ve ever played, with updated stages, bosses, weapons, and some cool programming tricks I’ve never seen elsewhere. https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/910/

  > Oh, and one last goodie. Mega Man II on the GameBoy is not the strongest entry in the series, but it’s stil a quick, fun little game. The tinny, off-pitch music kind of ruins it for a lot of folks, though. So, this patch updates the entire sound font, lowering the pitch and fixing some unintended blue notes. https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4695/

  > Pair the above with this graphics hack that fixes the “crunched” look of some of the sprites, and you have something a little closer to a traditional MM experience: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6164/
